Project Description                                         
The Room Allotment and Booking System is a console-based application developed in C++ using Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).                                                   
This project aims to streamline the process of booking and allotting rooms for various purposes, such as hotels, hostels, or event spaces. It efficiently manages room availability, booking status, and user information using advanced data structures.
